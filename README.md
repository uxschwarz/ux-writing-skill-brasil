# UX Writing Skill for Claude

> Scale content quality through AI-powered design system enforcement

An Agent Skill that enables Claude to write and edit user-centered interface copy (UX text/microcopy) for digital products. This skill transforms Claude into a specialized UX writing assistant that applies consistent standards, patterns, and voice across your product.

## The Problem

Design systems solve visual consistency, but content quality still depends on individual writers. Every error message, button label, and empty state requires manual review to ensure it's clear, concise, conversational, and purposeful. This doesn't scale.

## The Solution

This Agent Skill packages UX writing expertise into a system that Claude can apply automatically. Instead of asking "make this better," you can rely on consistent, evidence-based improvements across your entire product interface.

## What Makes This Different

**Systems thinking, not style guides**: This isn't a list of writing tips. It's a framework for evaluating and improving UX text based on four measurable quality standards.

**Progressive disclosure**: Reference materials are loaded only when needed, keeping Claude's context efficient while providing deep expertise on demand.

**Proven patterns**: Built from real-world UX writing best practices, with examples across different product voices and contexts.

**Immediately actionable**: Every pattern includes concrete before/after examples and scoring against quality standards.

## What You Get

### Core Framework
- **Four quality standards**: Purposeful, Concise, Conversational, Clear
- **Common UX patterns**: Buttons, errors, empty states, forms, notifications, onboarding
- **Editing process**: Systematic approach to improving any interface text
- **Voice and tone guidance**: Adapt content to brand personality and context
- **Accessibility guidelines**: Write for screen readers, cognitive accessibility, and WCAG compliance
- **Research-backed benchmarks**: Sentence length targets, comprehension rates, reading levels

### Reference Materials
- **Accessibility guidelines**: Comprehensive guide for writing inclusive, accessible UX text
- **Voice chart template**: Establish consistent brand personality
- **Content usability checklist**: Evaluate text quality with scoring framework
- **Detailed pattern examples**: See how different voices apply the same patterns

### Practical Tools
- **Real-world improvements**: Before/after transformations with analysis
- **Fillable templates**: Error messages, empty states, onboarding flows
- **Expanded error patterns**: Validation, system, blocking, and permission errors with examples
- **Tone adaptation framework**: Map emotional states to appropriate tone
- **Quick reference**: Common patterns and anti-patterns

## Use Cases

**For content designers**: Apply consistent UX writing standards across your product without memorizing every rule.

**For product teams**: Enable non-writers to create interface copy that follows your design system.

**For design system teams**: Enforce content guidelines at scale without becoming a bottleneck.

**For early-stage products**: Build content quality in from the start with proven patterns.

## Installation

### What You Need

This skill works with **Claude Code** (the AI coding assistant). If you don't have Claude Code yet, visit [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) to get started.

### Step-by-Step Installation

**Step 1: Download This Skill**

1. On this GitHub page, look for the green **"Code"** button near the top
2. Click it and select **"Download ZIP"**
3. Find the downloaded file (usually in your Downloads folder)
4. Double-click the ZIP file to extract it

**Step 2: Find Your Skills Folder**

The skills folder is where Claude Code looks for custom skills. Here's how to find or create it:

**On Mac:**
1. Open Finder
2. Press `Command + Shift + G` (this opens "Go to Folder")
3. Type: `~/.claude/skills`
4. Press Enter
5. If you see "folder doesn't exist", create it:
   - Type `~/.claude` instead and press Enter
   - Right-click in the window and select "New Folder"
   - Name it `skills`

**On Windows:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. In the address bar, type: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills`
3. Press Enter
4. If you see "folder doesn't exist", create it:
   - Type `%USERPROFILE%\.claude` instead and press Enter
   - Right-click and select "New" → "Folder"
   - Name it `skills`

**Step 3: Install the Skill**

1. Open the extracted folder from Step 1
2. Inside, you'll see a folder called `ux-writing`
3. **Copy the entire `ux-writing` folder** (not just the files inside it)
4. Paste it into your skills folder from Step 2

Your skills folder should now look like this:
```
.claude/
  skills/
    ux-writing/
      SKILL.md
      references/
      examples/
      templates/
      (and other files)
```

**Step 4: Restart Claude Code**

1. Completely quit Claude Code (don't just close the window)
2. Reopen Claude Code
3. The skill is now installed!

**Step 5: Verify It's Working**

Try asking Claude Code:
```
Write an error message for when a payment fails
```

If the skill is working, Claude will apply UX writing best practices and create a clear, empathetic error message. You can also ask:
```
What UX writing skills do you have?
```

Claude should mention the UX Writing Skill in its response.

### For Teams: Project Installation

Want your whole team to use this skill automatically?

1. Copy the `ux-writing` folder to `.claude/skills/` in your project's root directory
2. Commit it to your repository (Git, etc.)
3. When teammates pull the code, they'll automatically get the skill

**Note**: Project skills only work when Claude Code is opened in that project folder.

## Figma Integration

**Review and improve UX copy directly from your Figma designs!**

Connect this skill to Figma so Claude can analyze mockups, audit copy, and suggest improvements based on UX writing best practices. Perfect for:
- Content designers reviewing flows before launch
- Product teams iterating on copy in designs
- Design QA and accessibility audits
- Cross-platform consistency checks

### Quick Start

1. **Connect Figma to Claude Code** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp
   ```
   Restart Claude Code and authenticate with Figma when prompted.

2. **Share a Figma frame link** with Claude:
   ```
   Review the UX copy in this login screen:
   https://www.figma.com/file/abc123/Design?node-id=123-456

   Check for accessibility, clarity, and tone.
   ```

3. **Get instant feedback** with specific improvements based on the four quality standards.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```
Write an error message for when a payment fails
```

Claude applies the skill automatically and generates clear, actionable error messages following best practices.

### Editing Existing Copy

```
Review this button label: "Submit your information for processing"
```

Claude evaluates against the four quality standards and suggests improvements.

### Creating Consistent Patterns

```
Create empty state copy for a task list, keeping voice consistent with:
- Purposeful, Concise, Conversational, Clear
- Professional but friendly tone
```

Claude applies the appropriate patterns and maintains voice consistency.

### Evaluating Quality

```
Score this error message:
"An error occurred. Please try again later."
```

Claude uses the content usability checklist to provide detailed scoring and improvement suggestions.

## How It Works

This skill uses **model-invoked activation** — Claude automatically decides when to use it based on your request. You don't need to explicitly call the skill; it activates when you:

- Write or edit interface copy
- Create error messages, notifications, or empty states
- Work on button labels, form fields, or instructions
- Review product content for consistency
- Establish voice and tone guidelines

Claude loads reference materials progressively, using only what's needed for your specific task to maintain efficient context usage.

## What You'll Learn

Using this skill exposes the systematic thinking behind effective UX writing:

- How to evaluate content objectively with scoring frameworks
- Why certain patterns work across different product contexts
- How voice stays consistent while tone adapts to situations
- The difference between writing for clarity vs. writing for personality

## For Content Design Teams

This skill can serve as:

- **Onboarding tool**: New team members learn patterns faster
- **Quality baseline**: Consistent standards across all writers
- **Efficiency multiplier**: Generate first drafts that follow guidelines
- **System documentation**: Reference materials that never go stale

## Why This Matters

Content is infrastructure. Every button label, error message, and empty state shapes how people understand and use your product. Good UX writing shouldn't depend on having an expert review every string. 

This skill makes UX writing excellence systematic, scalable, and consistent — exactly what design systems do for visual design.
